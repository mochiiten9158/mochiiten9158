# About
I am Shambhawi Sharma (she/her), a fourth year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business and Computational Mathematics! I aspire to do a doctorate degree towards systems research, preferably in the field of High Performance Computing.

### Projects
* **Python TUI Bank Application**
    * I created a TUI Bank application using psycopg2 and Python. The Banking Application possessed a database made on postgres and pgadmin4 which could be accessed by customers, bank managers and tellers to perform functions such as adding accounts, deleting accounts and cash withdrawals, deposits and transfers.
* **Android Weather App and Android News App**
     * I created a Weather App in Android Studio that utilizes real time weather information from an external API source to display real time weather for any part of the world, along with weather icons imported using a local library. The Weather App I built displayed weather information for not only the same day but also up to the next 15 days, with display options in the metric as well as other systems. The News app displayed all news sources from an external API that allowed users to choose news articles from a specific source for a specific topic. The titles and articles itself are stored and displayed using an Adapter and View Holder, while the list of available sources and topics are accessed using Hash Maps that are used to navigate between articles.
* **Java Game: Race Between Two Campuses**
     * I, along with a team of students (Ryan Ciminski, Olivia Debenedictis, Matthew Horowitz) created a game map similar to chutes and ladders, coded for a three-class project with application of concepts like exception handling, object oriented programming and inheritance.

### Work Experience
* **Undergraduate Research Assistant (January 2023 - May 2023)**
     * The research was done under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Zhiling Lan. Work done during the Spring semester of 2023 under CS497 was to understand technologies in Parallel Discrete Event Simulations (PDES) and work with them to learn about High Performance Computing and job scheduling. The two technologies that were primarily investigated and learned from were CODES Discrete Event Simulation Framework and CQSIMä¸€a discrete event driven scheduling simulator.
     * What I really enjoyed with this experience was it made me interested in High Performance Computing research, and I hope to continue in the same field in the near future.
* **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (January 2022 - May 2023)**
     * I taught and helped students in the classroom understand basic programming concepts in Java. Required experience with teaching and reviewing course material of the week and explaining concepts of data structures in Java. Developed leadership, communication and problem-solving skills to better help students.
     * It's really lots of fun to hear the various ways others approach a certain problem, and it was a really interactive and enjoyable experience to be involved as a teaching assistant!
* **CRA Intern at FIGmd (May 2022 - August 2022)**
     * I collaborated with an internal Carefirst Team consisting of 20 memebers including healthcare professionals as well as data scientists to prepare .html files and excel databases to evaluate the quality of medical practitioners and systems based on CMS measures. I addressed the issue of efficiency and correctness in entering data in the excel database so as to obtain accurate results. I received training for and worked with the MAT tool, VSAT tool and advanced Excel functions to work with various measure attributes and conditions to create automated .xlxs files
     * One key takeaway from the experience was the extent to which I required my previous knowledge of biology to be able to effectively contribute towards designing an efficient database system, and it really highlighted the importance of having interdisciplinary knowledge. Overall, a very rewarding experience!

###Interests and Future Goals
In my free time, I rather enjoy reading academic papers on various topics. I am currently trying to read more papers regarding HPCs in order to gain more knowledge about them. Apart from papers, I enjoy playing video games and listening to classical music!
